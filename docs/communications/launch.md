ðŸš€ UaiCoin beats TrumpCoin and makes me a millionaire! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’Ž

Just kidding! But for a moment, I imagined what it would be like to be the next memecoin tycoon. ðŸ˜‚

Inspired by the hype around coins like TrumpCoin, I decided to create UaiCoin, a Brazilian memecoin that celebrates the culture of Minas Gerais. The goal? Not to get rich, but to learn and have some fun along the way!

For this project, I developed an ERC-20 smart contract for the UAI token, explored blockchain fundamentals, designed a landing page with HTML and Tailwind CSS, and worked with local testing tools like Hardhat and Ganache.

ðŸŽ¯ What I learned:
â€¢ How to create a token following the ERC-20 standard;
â€¢ The fundamentals of smart contracts and Solidity;
â€¢ Simulating a blockchain environment for secure development;
â€¢ Working with modern tools like Hardhat and Remix IDE;
â€¢ Building responsive and creative interfaces to showcase the project.

UaiCoin may be fictional, but the knowledge I gained is very real! ðŸš€

If Trump can have his own memecoin, why canâ€™t Brazil? UAI sÃ´! ðŸ˜„
